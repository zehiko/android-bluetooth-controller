Bluetooth Controller is a simple Android application for connecting to bluetooth devices and sending and receiving data. For now, it is primarily designed to be used for communication with Arduino board, so it has hardcoded well-known device UUID (00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB).

There are two basic activities, one is used for discovering nearby devices and initiating connection to a specific device and other for communication with connected device.

TODO:
- adding custom uuid
- arduino command configuration
- improve design
